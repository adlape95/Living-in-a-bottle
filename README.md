# Living in a bottle project
This repository includes all the code and intermediate files used to analyze the data associated to our manuscript "Living in a bottle: Bacteria from sediment-associated Mediterranean waste and potential growth on polyethylene terephthalate (PET)", which will be soon available.

Commands for bioinformatic analyses can be found in "Qiime2-commnads.sh", while the code used for the statistical analysis and data visualization is available on "R_analysis_LivingInABottle.Rmd". All the data and tables needed for the analyses are included in the repository.
